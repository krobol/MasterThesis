    abstract = { Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a life-threatening condition associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, and it remains a challenge to diagnose and treat. The International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection was established in 1996 with the mission to raise awareness of this condition and provide insights to guide diagnosis and treatment. Since then, \&gt;7300 cases have been included from \&gt;51 sites in 12 countries. Although presenting symptoms and physical findings have not changed significantly over this period, the use of computed tomography in the diagnosis has increased, and more patients are managed with interventional procedures: surgery in type A AAD and endovascular therapy in type B AAD; with these changes in care, there has been a significant decrease in overall in-hospital mortality in type A AAD but not in type B AAD. Herein, we summarized the key lessons learned from this international registry of patients with AAD over the past 20 years. }
